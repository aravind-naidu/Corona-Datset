### Corona-Datset


Corona datasets are readily available as csv, jason and more formats online.
I have used a csv data from: [CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) 

The dataset consists of three blocks:
  1. Confirmd
  2. Deaths
  3. Recovered
 All in a timeseries format.
 
Here I have tailored the data to my requirements, and in the end I have represented the data in a dataframe with just the key elements namely: Country Name, Latitude, Longitude, Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered.
