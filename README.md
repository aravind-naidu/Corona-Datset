### Working on Corona-Datset 
>This is a small experimental code to play around with few Corona Datasets and learn while practicing.
I have made this repository to help beginners learn and understand the basics more.
While I was a beginner many such people's Githubs, Stackoverflow, Medium blogs and websites helped me to learn.
This is my way of giving back when I can.
>Happy Learning!!!

Corona datasets are readily available as csv, jason and more formats online.
I have used a csv data from: [CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) 

The dataset consists of three blocks:
  1. Confirmd
  2. Deaths
  3. Recovered
 All in a timeseries format.
 
Here I have tailored the data to my requirements, and in the end I have represented the data in a dataframe with just the key elements namely: Country Name, Latitude, Longitude, Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered. 
 
>This will help beginners to learn Preparing a dataset out of few others.

>Using basic API and writing functions for it.

>Doing basic analysis of the datasets.

>Well commented explainations for learning as you read the code.
